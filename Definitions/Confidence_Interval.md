Confidence Interval:

a type of interval estimate, computed from the statistics of the observed data, that might contain the true value of an unknown population parameter. The interval has an associated confidence level, or coverage that, loosely speaking, quantifies the level of confidence that the deterministic parameter is captured by the interval.

Confidence Interval = x̅ ± z * σ / sqrt(n) where x̅ is sample mean, z is z-score, σ is population standard deviation, n is sample size
